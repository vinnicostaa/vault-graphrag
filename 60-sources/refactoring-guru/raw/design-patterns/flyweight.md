##  Intent

**Flyweight** is a structural design pattern that lets you fit more
objects into the available amount of RAM by sharing common parts of
state between multiple objects instead of keeping all of the data in
each object.

::: {.section .problem}
##  Problem

To have some fun after long working hours, you decided to create a
simple video game: players would be moving around a map and shooting
each other. You chose to implement a realistic particle system and make
it a distinctive feature of the game. Vast quantities of bullets,
missiles, and shrapnel from explosions should fly all over the map and
deliver a thrilling experience to the player.

Upon its completion, you pushed the last commit, built the game and sent
it to your friend for a test drive. Although the game was running
flawlessly on your machine, your friend wasn't able to play for long. On
his computer, the game kept crashing after a few minutes of gameplay.
After spending several hours digging through debug logs, you discovered
that the game crashed because of an insufficient amount of RAM. It
turned out that your friend's rig was much less powerful than your own
computer, and that's why the problem emerged so quickly on his machine.

The actual problem was related to your particle system. Each particle,
such as a bullet, a missile or a piece of shrapnel was represented by a
separate object containing plenty of data. At some point, when the
carnage on a player's screen reached its climax, newly created particles
no longer fit into the remaining RAM, so the program crashed.

::: {.section .solution}
##  Solution

On closer inspection of the `Particle` class, you may notice that the
color and sprite fields consume a lot more memory than other fields.
What's worse is that these two fields store almost identical data across
all particles. For example, all bullets have the same color and sprite.

<figure class="image">
<img
src="../images/patterns/diagrams/flyweight/solution1-en7ebd.png?id=4b962ce51832e49a24f16f36be79ec45"

alt="Flyweight pattern solution" />
</figure>

Other parts of a particle's state, such as coordinates, movement vector
and speed, are unique to each particle. After all, the values of these
fields change over time. This data represents the always changing
context in which the particle exists, while the color and sprite remain
constant for each particle.

This constant data of an object is usually called the *intrinsic state*.
It lives within the object; other objects can only read it, not change
it. The rest of the object's state, often altered "from the outside" by
other objects, is called the *extrinsic state*.

The Flyweight pattern suggests that you stop storing the extrinsic state
inside the object. Instead, you should pass this state to specific
methods which rely on it. Only the intrinsic state stays within the
object, letting you reuse it in different contexts. As a result, you'd
need fewer of these objects since they only differ in the intrinsic
state, which has much fewer variations than the extrinsic.

</figure>

Let's return to our game. Assuming that we had extracted the extrinsic
state from our particle class, only three different objects would
suffice to represent all particles in the game: a bullet, a missile, and
a piece of shrapnel. As you've probably guessed by now, an object that
only stores the intrinsic state is called a flyweight.

#### Extrinsic state storage

Where does the extrinsic state move to? Some class should still store
it, right? In most cases, it gets moved to the container object, which
aggregates objects before we apply the pattern.

In our case, that's the main `Game` object that stores all particles in
the `particles` field. To move the extrinsic state into this class, you
need to create several array fields for storing coordinates, vectors,
and speed of each individual particle. But that's not all. You need
another array for storing references to a specific flyweight that
represents a particle. These arrays must be in sync so that you can
access all data of a particle using the same index.

<figure class="image">
<img
src="../images/patterns/diagrams/flyweight/solution2-en0491.png?id=3e4154df627d99ecd099e07301f8eb81"

sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 640px" loading="lazy" width="640"
alt="Flyweight pattern solution" />
</figure>

A more elegant solution is to create a separate context class that would
store the extrinsic state along with reference to the flyweight object.
This approach would require having just a single array in the container
class.

Wait a second! Won't we need to have as many of these contextual objects
as we had at the very beginning? Technically, yes. But the thing is,
these objects are much smaller than before. The most memory-consuming
fields have been moved to just a few flyweight objects. Now, a thousand
small contextual objects can reuse a single heavy flyweight object
instead of storing a thousand copies of its data.

#### Flyweight and immutability

Since the same flyweight object can be used in different contexts, you
have to make sure that its state can't be modified. A flyweight should
initialize its state just once, via constructor parameters. It shouldn't
expose any setters or public fields to other objects.

#### Flyweight factory

For more convenient access to various flyweights, you can create a
factory method that manages a pool of existing flyweight objects. The
method accepts the intrinsic state of the desired flyweight from a
client, looks for an existing flyweight object matching this state, and
returns it if it was found. If not, it creates a new flyweight and adds
it to the pool.

There are several options where this method could be placed. The most
obvious place is a flyweight container. Alternatively, you could create
a new factory class. Or you could make the factory method static and put
it inside an actual flyweight class.

:::

1.  The Flyweight pattern is merely an optimization. Before applying it,
    make sure your program does have the RAM consumption problem related
    to having a massive number of similar objects in memory at the same
    time. Make sure that this problem can't be solved in any other
    meaningful way.

2.  The **Flyweight** class contains the portion of the original
    object's state that can be shared between multiple objects. The same
    flyweight object can be used in many different contexts. The state
    stored inside a flyweight is called *intrinsic.* The state passed to
    the flyweight's methods is called *extrinsic.*

3.  The **Context** class contains the extrinsic state, unique across
    all original objects. When a context is paired with one of the
    flyweight objects, it represents the full state of the original
    object.

4.  Usually, the behavior of the original object remains in the
    flyweight class. In this case, whoever calls a flyweight's method
    must also pass appropriate bits of the extrinsic state into the
    method's parameters. On the other hand, the behavior can be moved to
    the context class, which would use the linked flyweight merely as a
    data object.

5.  The **Client** calculates or stores the extrinsic state of
    flyweights. From the client's perspective, a flyweight is a template
    object which can be configured at runtime by passing some contextual
    data into parameters of its methods.

6.  The **Flyweight Factory** manages a pool of existing flyweights.
    With the factory, clients don't create flyweights directly. Instead,
    they call the factory, passing it bits of the intrinsic state of the
    desired flyweight. The factory looks over previously created
    flyweights and either returns an existing one that matches search
    criteria or creates a new one if nothing is found.

##  Pseudocode

In this example, the **Flyweight** pattern helps to reduce memory usage
when rendering millions of tree objects on a canvas.

The pattern extracts the repeating intrinsic state from a main `Tree`
class and moves it into the flyweight class `TreeType`.

Now instead of storing the same data in multiple objects, it's kept in
just a few flyweight objects and linked to appropriate `Tree` objects
which act as contexts. The client code creates new tree objects using
the flyweight factory, which encapsulates the complexity of searching
for the right object and reusing it if needed.

<figure class="code">

##  Applicability

::::: applicability
::: applicability-problem
Use the Flyweight pattern only when your program must support a huge
number of objects which barely fit into available RAM.
:::

::: applicability-solution
The benefit of applying the pattern depends heavily on how and where
it's used. It's most useful when:

-   an application needs to spawn a huge number of similar objects
-   this drains all available RAM on a target device
-   the objects contain duplicate states which can be extracted and
    shared between multiple objects
:::
:::::
::::::

::: {.section .checklist}
##  How to Implement {#checklist}

1.  Divide fields of a class that will become a flyweight into two
    parts:

    -   the intrinsic state: the fields that contain unchanging data
        duplicated across many objects
    -   the extrinsic state: the fields that contain contextual data
        unique to each object

2.  Leave the fields that represent the intrinsic state in the class,
    but make sure they're immutable. They should take their initial
    values only inside the constructor.

3.  Go over methods that use fields of the extrinsic state. For each
    field used in the method, introduce a new parameter and use it
    instead of the field.

4.  Optionally, create a factory class to manage the pool of flyweights.
    It should check for an existing flyweight before creating a new one.
    Once the factory is in place, clients must only request flyweights
    through it. They should describe the desired flyweight by passing
    its intrinsic state to the factory.

5.  The client must store or calculate values of the extrinsic state
    (context) to be able to call methods of flyweight objects. For the
    sake of convenience, the extrinsic state along with the
    flyweight-referencing field may be moved to a separate context
    class.

##  Pros and Cons {#pros-cons}

::::: row
::: col-sm-6
-    You can save lots of RAM, assuming your program has tons of similar
    objects.
:::

::: col-sm-6
-    You might be trading RAM over CPU cycles when some of the context
    data needs to be recalculated each time somebody calls a flyweight
    method.
-    The code becomes much more complicated. New team members will
    always be wondering why the state of an entity was separated in such
    a way.
:::

::: {.section .relations}
##  Relations with Other Patterns {#relations}

-   You can implement shared leaf nodes of the
    [Composite](composite.html) tree as [Flyweights](flyweight.html) to
    save some RAM.

-   [Flyweight](flyweight.html) shows how to make lots of little
    objects, whereas [Facade](facade.html) shows how to make a single
    object that represents an entire subsystem.

-   [Flyweight](flyweight.html) would resemble
    [Singleton](singleton.html) if you somehow managed to reduce all
    shared states of the objects to just one flyweight object. But there
    are two fundamental differences between these patterns:

    1.  There should be only one Singleton instance, whereas a
        *Flyweight* class can have multiple instances with different
        intrinsic states.
    2.  The *Singleton* object can be mutable. Flyweight objects are
        immutable.
