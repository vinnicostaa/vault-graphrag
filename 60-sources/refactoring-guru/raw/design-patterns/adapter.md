##  Intent

**Adapter** is a structural design pattern that allows objects with
incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

##  Problem

Imagine that you're creating a stock market monitoring app. The app
downloads the stock data from multiple sources in XML format and then
displays nice-looking charts and diagrams for the user.

At some point, you decide to improve the app by integrating a smart
3rd-party analytics library. But there's a catch: the analytics library
only works with data in JSON format.

<figure class="image">

<figcaption><p>You can’t use the analytics library “as is” because it
expects the data in a format that’s incompatible with
your app.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

You could change the library to work with XML. However, this might break
some existing code that relies on the library. And worse, you might not
have access to the library's source code in the first place, making this
approach impossible.
:::

::: {.section .solution}
##  Solution

You can create an *adapter*. This is a special object that converts the
interface of one object so that another object can understand it.

An adapter wraps one of the objects to hide the complexity of conversion
happening behind the scenes. The wrapped object isn't even aware of the
adapter. For example, you can wrap an object that operates in meters and
kilometers with an adapter that converts all of the data to imperial
units such as feet and miles.

Adapters can not only convert data into various formats but can also
help objects with different interfaces collaborate. Here's how it works:

1.  The adapter gets an interface, compatible with one of the existing
    objects.
2.  Using this interface, the existing object can safely call the
    adapter's methods.
3.  Upon receiving a call, the adapter passes the request to the second
    object, but in a format and order that the second object expects.

Sometimes it's even possible to create a two-way adapter that can
convert the calls in both directions.

</figure>

Let's get back to our stock market app. To solve the dilemma of
incompatible formats, you can create XML-to-JSON adapters for every
class of the analytics library that your code works with directly. Then
you adjust your code to communicate with the library only via these
adapters. When an adapter receives a call, it translates the incoming
XML data into a JSON structure and passes the call to the appropriate
methods of a wrapped analytics object.

When you travel from the US to Europe for the first time, you may get a
surprise when trying to charge your laptop. The power plug and sockets
standards are different in different countries. That's why your US plug
won't fit a German socket. The problem can be solved by using a power
plug adapter that has the American-style socket and the European-style
plug.

#### Object adapter

This implementation uses the object composition principle: the adapter
implements the interface of one object and wraps the other one. It can
be implemented in all popular programming languages.

1.  The **Client** is a class that contains the existing business logic
    of the program.

2.  The **Client Interface** describes a protocol that other classes
    must follow to be able to collaborate with the client code.

3.  The **Service** is some useful class (usually 3rd-party or legacy).
    The client can't use this class directly because it has an
    incompatible interface.

4.  The **Adapter** is a class that's able to work with both the client
    and the service: it implements the client interface, while wrapping
    the service object. The adapter receives calls from the client via
    the client interface and translates them into calls to the wrapped
    service object in a format it can understand.

5.  The client code doesn't get coupled to the concrete adapter class as
    long as it works with the adapter via the client interface. Thanks
    to this, you can introduce new types of adapters into the program
    without breaking the existing client code. This can be useful when
    the interface of the service class gets changed or replaced: you can
    just create a new adapter class without changing the client code.

#### Class adapter

This implementation uses inheritance: the adapter inherits interfaces
from both objects at the same time. Note that this approach can only be
implemented in programming languages that support multiple inheritance,
such as C++.

1.  The **Class Adapter** doesn't need to wrap any objects because it
    inherits behaviors from both the client and the service. The
    adaptation happens within the overridden methods. The resulting
    adapter can be used in place of an existing client class.

between square pegs and round holes.

The Adapter pretends to be a round peg, with a radius equal to a half of
the square's diameter (in other words, the radius of the smallest circle
that can accommodate the square peg).

<figure class="code">
<pre class="code" lang="pseudocode"><code>// Say you have two classes with compatible interfaces:
// RoundHole and RoundPeg.
class RoundHole is
    constructor RoundHole(radius) { ... }

    method getRadius() is

    method fits(peg: RoundPeg) is

// But there&#39;s an incompatible class: SquarePeg.
class SquarePeg is
    constructor SquarePeg(width) { ... }

    method getWidth() is
        // Return the square peg width.


// An adapter class lets you fit square pegs into round holes.
// It extends the RoundPeg class to let the adapter objects act
// as round pegs.
class SquarePegAdapter extends RoundPeg is
    // In reality, the adapter contains an instance of the
    // SquarePeg class.
    private field peg: SquarePeg

##  Applicability

::::::: applicability
::: applicability-problem
Use the Adapter class when you want to use some existing class, but its
interface isn't compatible with the rest of your code.
:::

::: applicability-solution
The Adapter pattern lets you create a middle-layer class that serves as
a translator between your code and a legacy class, a 3rd-party class or
any other class with a weird interface.
:::

::: applicability-problem
Use the pattern when you want to reuse several existing subclasses that
lack some common functionality that can't be added to the superclass.
:::

::: applicability-solution
You could extend each subclass and put the missing functionality into
new child classes. However, you'll need to duplicate the code across all
of these new classes, which [smells really
bad](../smells/duplicate-code.html).

The much more elegant solution would be to put the missing functionality
into an adapter class. Then you would wrap objects with missing features
inside the adapter, gaining needed features dynamically. For this to
work, the target classes must have a common interface, and the adapter's
field should follow that interface. This approach looks very similar to
the [Decorator](decorator.html) pattern.
:::
:::::::
::::::::

::: {.section .checklist}
##  How to Implement {#checklist}

1.  Make sure that you have at least two classes with incompatible
    interfaces:

    -   A useful *service* class, which you can't change (often
        3rd-party, legacy or with lots of existing dependencies).
    -   One or several *client* classes that would benefit from using
        the service class.

2.  Declare the client interface and describe how clients communicate
    with the service.

3.  Create the adapter class and make it follow the client interface.
    Leave all the methods empty for now.

4.  Add a field to the adapter class to store a reference to the service
    object. The common practice is to initialize this field via the
    constructor, but sometimes it's more convenient to pass it to the
    adapter when calling its methods.

5.  One by one, implement all methods of the client interface in the
    adapter class. The adapter should delegate most of the real work to
    the service object, handling only the interface or data format
    conversion.

6.  Clients should use the adapter via the client interface. This will
    let you change or extend the adapters without affecting the client
    code.
:::

:::::: {.section .pros-cons}
##  Pros and Cons {#pros-cons}

::::: row
::: col-sm-6
-    *Single Responsibility Principle*. You can separate the interface
    or data conversion code from the primary business logic of the
    program.
-    *Open/Closed Principle*. You can introduce new types of adapters
    into the program without breaking the existing client code, as long
    as they work with the adapters through the client interface.
:::

::: col-sm-6
-    The overall complexity of the code increases because you need to
    introduce a set of new interfaces and classes. Sometimes it's
    simpler just to change the service class so that it matches the rest
    of your code.
:::
:::::
::::::

::: {.section .relations}
##  Relations with Other Patterns {#relations}

-   [Bridge](bridge.html) is usually designed up-front, letting you
    develop parts of an application independently of each other. On the
    other hand, [Adapter](adapter.html) is commonly used with an
    existing app to make some otherwise-incompatible classes work
    together nicely.

-   [Adapter](adapter.html) provides a completely different interface
    for accessing an existing object. On the other hand, with the
    [Decorator](decorator.html) pattern the interface either stays the
    same or gets extended. In addition, *Decorator* supports recursive
    composition, which isn't possible when you use *Adapter*.

-   With [Adapter](adapter.html) you access an existing object via
    different interface. With [Proxy](proxy.html), the interface stays
    the same. With [Decorator](decorator.html) you access the object via
    an enhanced interface.

-   [Facade](facade.html) defines a new interface for existing objects,
    whereas [Adapter](adapter.html) tries to make the existing interface
    usable. *Adapter* usually wraps just one object, while *Facade*
    works with an entire subsystem of objects.

-   [Bridge](bridge.html), [State](state.html),
    [Strategy](strategy.html) (and to some degree
    [Adapter](adapter.html)) have very similar structures. Indeed, all
    of these patterns are based on composition, which is delegating work
    to other objects. However, they all solve different problems. A
    pattern isn't just a recipe for structuring your code in a specific
    way. It can also communicate to other developers the problem the
    pattern solves.
