##  Intent

**Mediator** is a behavioral design pattern that lets you reduce chaotic
dependencies between objects. The pattern restricts direct
communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only
via a mediator object.

##  Problem

Say you have a dialog for creating and editing customer profiles. It
consists of various form controls such as text fields, checkboxes,
buttons, etc.

<figure class="image">

alt="Chaotic relations between elements of the user interface" />
<figcaption><p>Relations between elements of the user interface can
become chaotic as the application evolves.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

Some of the form elements may interact with others. For instance,
selecting the "I have a dog" checkbox may reveal a hidden text field for
entering the dog's name. Another example is the submit button that has
to validate values of all fields before saving the data.

<figure class="image">

alt="Elements of the UI are interdependent" />
<figcaption><p>Elements can have lots of relations with other elements.
Hence, changes to some elements may affect the others.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

By having this logic implemented directly inside the code of the form
elements you make these elements' classes much harder to reuse in other
forms of the app. For example, you won't be able to use that checkbox
class inside another form, because it's coupled to the dog's text field.
You can use either all the classes involved in rendering the profile
form, or none at all.
:::

::: {.section .solution}
##  Solution

The Mediator pattern suggests that you should cease all direct
communication between the components which you want to make independent
of each other. Instead, these components must collaborate indirectly, by
calling a special mediator object that redirects the calls to
appropriate components. As a result, the components depend only on a
single mediator class instead of being coupled to dozens of their
colleagues.

In our example with the profile editing form, the dialog class itself
may act as the mediator. Most likely, the dialog class is already aware
of all of its sub-elements, so you won't even need to introduce new
dependencies into this class.

<figure class="image">

alt="UI elements should communicate via the mediator." />
<figcaption><p>UI elements should communicate indirectly, via the
mediator object.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

The most significant change happens to the actual form elements. Let's
consider the submit button. Previously, each time a user clicked the
button, it had to validate the values of all individual form elements.
Now its single job is to notify the dialog about the click. Upon
receiving this notification, the dialog itself performs the validations
or passes the task to the individual elements. Thus, instead of being
tied to a dozen form elements, the button is only dependent on the
dialog class.

You can go further and make the dependency even looser by extracting the
common interface for all types of dialogs. The interface would declare
the notification method which all form elements can use to notify the
dialog about events happening to those elements. Thus, our submit button
should now be able to work with any dialog that implements that
interface.

This way, the Mediator pattern lets you encapsulate a complex web of
relations between various objects inside a single mediator object. The
fewer dependencies a class has, the easier it becomes to modify, extend
or reuse that class.

</figure>

Pilots of aircraft that approach or depart the airport control area
don't communicate directly with each other. Instead, they speak to an
air traffic controller, who sits in a tall tower somewhere near the
airstrip. Without the air traffic controller, pilots would need to be
aware of every plane in the vicinity of the airport, discussing landing
priorities with a committee of dozens of other pilots. That would
probably skyrocket the airplane crash statistics.

The tower doesn't need to control the whole flight. It exists only to
enforce constraints in the terminal area because the number of involved
actors there might be overwhelming to a pilot.

1.  **Components** are various classes that contain some business logic.
    Each component has a reference to a mediator, declared with the type
    of the mediator interface. The component isn't aware of the actual
    class of the mediator, so you can reuse the component in other
    programs by linking it to a different mediator.

2.  The **Mediator** interface declares methods of communication with
    components, which usually include just a single notification method.
    Components may pass any context as arguments of this method,
    including their own objects, but only in such a way that no coupling
    occurs between a receiving component and the sender's class.

3.  **Concrete Mediators** encapsulate relations between various
    components. Concrete mediators often keep references to all
    components they manage and sometimes even manage their lifecycle.

4.  Components must not be aware of other components. If something
    important happens within or to a component, it must only notify the
    mediator. When the mediator receives the notification, it can easily
    identify the sender, which might be just enough to decide what
    component should be triggered in return.

    From a component's perspective, it all looks like a total black box.
    The sender doesn't know who'll end up handling its request, and the
    receiver doesn't know who sent the request in the first place.

In this example, the **Mediator** pattern helps you eliminate mutual
dependencies between various UI classes: buttons, checkboxes and text
labels.

An element, triggered by a user, doesn't communicate with other elements
directly, even if it looks like it's supposed to. Instead, the element
only needs to let its mediator know about the event, passing any
contextual info along with that notification.

In this example, the whole authentication dialog acts as the mediator.
It knows how concrete elements are supposed to collaborate and
facilitates their indirect communication. Upon receiving a notification
about an event, the dialog decides what element should address the event
and redirects the call accordingly.

##  Applicability

::::::::: applicability
::: applicability-problem
Use the Mediator pattern when it's hard to change some of the classes
because they are tightly coupled to a bunch of other classes.
:::

::: applicability-solution
The pattern lets you extract all the relationships between classes into
a separate class, isolating any changes to a specific component from the
rest of the components.
:::

::: applicability-problem
Use the pattern when you can't reuse a component in a different program
because it's too dependent on other components.
:::

::: applicability-solution
After you apply the Mediator, individual components become unaware of
the other components. They could still communicate with each other,
albeit indirectly, through a mediator object. To reuse a component in a
different app, you need to provide it with a new mediator class.
:::

::: applicability-problem
Use the Mediator when you find yourself creating tons of component
subclasses just to reuse some basic behavior in various contexts.
:::

::: applicability-solution
Since all relations between components are contained within the
mediator, it's easy to define entirely new ways for these components to
collaborate by introducing new mediator classes, without having to
change the components themselves.
:::
:::::::::
::::::::::

::: {.section .checklist}
##  How to Implement {#checklist}

1.  Identify a group of tightly coupled classes which would benefit from
    being more independent (e.g., for easier maintenance or simpler
    reuse of these classes).

2.  Declare the mediator interface and describe the desired
    communication protocol between mediators and various components. In
    most cases, a single method for receiving notifications from
    components is sufficient.

    This interface is crucial when you want to reuse component classes
    in different contexts. As long as the component works with its
    mediator via the generic interface, you can link the component with
    a different implementation of the mediator.

3.  Implement the concrete mediator class. Consider storing references
    to all components inside the mediator. This way, you could call any
    component from the mediator's methods.

4.  You can go even further and make the mediator responsible for the
    creation and destruction of component objects. After this, the
    mediator may resemble a [factory](abstract-factory.html) or a
    [facade](facade.html).

5.  Components should store a reference to the mediator object. The
    connection is usually established in the component's constructor,
    where a mediator object is passed as an argument.

6.  Change the components' code so that they call the mediator's
    notification method instead of methods on other components. Extract
    the code that involves calling other components into the mediator
    class. Execute this code whenever the mediator receives
    notifications from that component.

-    *Single Responsibility Principle*. You can extract the
    communications between various components into a single place,
    making it easier to comprehend and maintain.
-    *Open/Closed Principle*. You can introduce new mediators without
    having to change the actual components.

::: {.section .relations}
##  Relations with Other Patterns {#relations}

-   [Chain of Responsibility](chain-of-responsibility.html),
    [Command](command.html), [Mediator](mediator.html) and
    [Observer](observer.html) address various ways of connecting senders
    and receivers of requests:

    -   *Chain of Responsibility* passes a request sequentially along a
        dynamic chain of potential receivers until one of them handles
        it.
    -   *Command* establishes unidirectional connections between senders
        and receivers.
    -   *Mediator* eliminates direct connections between senders and
        receivers, forcing them to communicate indirectly via a mediator
        object.
    -   *Observer* lets receivers dynamically subscribe to and
        unsubscribe from receiving requests.

-   [Facade](facade.html) and [Mediator](mediator.html) have similar
    jobs: they try to organize collaboration between lots of tightly
    coupled classes.

    -   *Facade* defines a simplified interface to a subsystem of
        objects, but it doesn't introduce any new functionality. The
        subsystem itself is unaware of the facade. Objects within the
        subsystem can communicate directly.
    -   *Mediator* centralizes communication between components of the
        system. The components only know about the mediator object and
        don't communicate directly.

-   The difference between [Mediator](mediator.html) and
    [Observer](observer.html) is often elusive. In most cases, you can
    implement either of these patterns; but sometimes you can apply both
    simultaneously. Let's see how we can do that.

    The primary goal of *Mediator* is to eliminate mutual dependencies
    among a set of system components. Instead, these components become
    dependent on a single mediator object. The goal of *Observer* is to
    establish dynamic one-way connections between objects, where some
    objects act as subordinates of others.

    There's a popular implementation of the *Mediator* pattern that
    relies on *Observer*. The mediator object plays the role of
    publisher, and the components act as subscribers which subscribe to
    and unsubscribe from the mediator's events. When *Mediator* is
    implemented this way, it may look very similar to *Observer*.

    When you're confused, remember that you can implement the Mediator
    pattern in other ways. For example, you can permanently link all the
    components to the same mediator object. This implementation won't
    resemble *Observer* but will still be an instance of the Mediator
    pattern.

    Now imagine a program where all components have become publishers,
    allowing dynamic connections between each other. There won't be a
    centralized mediator object, only a distributed set of observers.
