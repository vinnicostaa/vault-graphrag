##  Intent

**Command** is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a
stand-alone object that contains all information about the request. This
transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or
queue a request's execution, and support undoable operations.

##  Problem

Imagine that you're working on a new text-editor app. Your current task
is to create a toolbar with a bunch of buttons for various operations of
the editor. You created a very neat `Button` class that can be used for
buttons on the toolbar, as well as for generic buttons in various
dialogs.

<figcaption><p>All buttons of the app are derived from the
same class.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

While all of these buttons look similar, they're all supposed to do
different things. Where would you put the code for the various click
handlers of these buttons? The simplest solution is to create tons of
subclasses for each place where the button is used. These subclasses
would contain the code that would have to be executed on a button click.

<figcaption><p>Lots of button subclasses. What can
go wrong?</p></figcaption>
</figure>

Before long, you realize that this approach is deeply flawed. First, you
have an enormous number of subclasses, and that would be okay if you
weren't risking breaking the code in these subclasses each time you
modify the base `Button` class. Put simply, your GUI code has become
awkwardly dependent on the volatile code of the business logic.

alt="Several classes implement the same functionality" />
<figcaption><p>Several classes implement the

</figure>

And here's the ugliest part. Some operations, such as copying/pasting
text, would need to be invoked from multiple places. For example, a user
could click a small "Copy" button on the toolbar, or copy something via
the context menu, or just hit `Ctrl+C` on the keyboard.

Initially, when our app only had the toolbar, it was okay to place the
implementation of various operations into the button subclasses. In
other words, having the code for copying text inside the `CopyButton`
subclass was fine. But then, when you implement context menus,
shortcuts, and other stuff, you have to either duplicate the operation's
code in many classes or make menus dependent on buttons, which is an
even worse option.
:::

::: {.section .solution}
##  Solution

Good software design is often based on the *principle of separation of
concerns*, which usually results in breaking an app into layers. The
most common example: a layer for the graphical user interface and
another layer for the business logic. The GUI layer is responsible for
rendering a beautiful picture on the screen, capturing any input and
showing results of what the user and the app are doing. However, when it
comes to doing something important, like calculating the trajectory of
the moon or composing an annual report, the GUI layer delegates the work
to the underlying layer of business logic.

In the code it might look like this: a GUI object calls a method of a
business logic object, passing it some arguments. This process is
usually described as one object sending another a *request*.

<figure class="image">
<img
src="../images/patterns/diagrams/command/solution1-en0f5a.png?id=ec37db1713fe2c1a9318886590667cfb"

alt="The GUI layer may access the business logic layer directly" />
<figcaption><p>The GUI objects may access the business logic
objects directly.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

The Command pattern suggests that GUI objects shouldn't send these
requests directly. Instead, you should extract all of the request
details, such as the object being called, the name of the method and the
list of arguments into a separate *command* class with a single method
that triggers this request.

Command objects serve as links between various GUI and business logic
objects. From now on, the GUI object doesn't need to know what business
logic object will receive the request and how it'll be processed. The
GUI object just triggers the command, which handles all the details.

<figure class="image">

alt="Accessing the business logic layer via a command." />
<figcaption><p>Accessing the business logic layer via
a command.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

The next step is to make your commands implement the same interface.
Usually it has just a single execution method that takes no parameters.
This interface lets you use various commands with the same request
sender, without coupling it to concrete classes of commands. As a bonus,
now you can switch command objects linked to the sender, effectively
changing the sender's behavior at runtime.

You might have noticed one missing piece of the puzzle, which is the
request parameters. A GUI object might have supplied the business-layer
object with some parameters. Since the command execution method doesn't
have any parameters, how would we pass the request details to the
receiver? It turns out the command should be either pre-configured with
this data, or capable of getting it on its own.

<figcaption><p>The GUI objects delegate the work
to commands.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

Let's get back to our text editor. After we apply the Command pattern,
we no longer need all those button subclasses to implement various click
behaviors. It's enough to put a single field into the base `Button`
class that stores a reference to a command object and make the button
execute that command on a click.

You'll implement a bunch of command classes for every possible operation
and link them with particular buttons, depending on the buttons'
intended behavior.

Other GUI elements, such as menus, shortcuts or entire dialogs, can be
implemented in the same way. They'll be linked to a command which gets
executed when a user interacts with the GUI element. As you've probably
guessed by now, the elements related to the same operations will be
linked to the same commands, preventing any code duplication.

As a result, commands become a convenient middle layer that reduces
coupling between the GUI and business logic layers. And that's only a
fraction of the benefits that the Command pattern can offer!

After a long walk through the city, you get to a nice restaurant and sit
at the table by the window. A friendly waiter approaches you and quickly
takes your order, writing it down on a piece of paper. The waiter goes
to the kitchen and sticks the order on the wall. After a while, the
order gets to the chef, who reads it and cooks the meal accordingly. The
cook places the meal on a tray along with the order. The waiter
discovers the tray, checks the order to make sure everything is as you
wanted it, and brings everything to your table.

The paper order serves as a command. It remains in a queue until the
chef is ready to serve it. The order contains all the relevant
information required to cook the meal. It allows the chef to start
cooking right away instead of running around clarifying the order
details from you directly.

1.  The **Sender** class (aka *invoker*) is responsible for initiating
    requests. This class must have a field for storing a reference to a
    command object. The sender triggers that command instead of sending
    the request directly to the receiver. Note that the sender isn't
    responsible for creating the command object. Usually, it gets a
    pre-created command from the client via the constructor.

2.  The **Command** interface usually declares just a single method for
    executing the command.

3.  **Concrete Commands** implement various kinds of requests. A
    concrete command isn't supposed to perform the work on its own, but
    rather to pass the call to one of the business logic objects.
    However, for the sake of simplifying the code, these classes can be
    merged.

    Parameters required to execute a method on a receiving object can be
    declared as fields in the concrete command. You can make command
    objects immutable by only allowing the initialization of these
    fields via the constructor.

4.  The **Receiver** class contains some business logic. Almost any
    object may act as a receiver. Most commands only handle the details
    of how a request is passed to the receiver, while the receiver
    itself does the actual work.

5.  The **Client** creates and configures concrete command objects. The
    client must pass all of the request parameters, including a receiver
    instance, into the command's constructor. After that, the resulting
    command may be associated with one or multiple senders.

<figcaption><p>Undoable operations in a text editor.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

Commands which result in changing the state of the editor (e.g., cutting
and pasting) make a backup copy of the editor's state before executing
an operation associated with the command. After a command is executed,
it's placed into the command history (a stack of command objects) along
with the backup copy of the editor's state at that point. Later, if the
user needs to revert an operation, the app can take the most recent
command from the history, read the associated backup of the editor's
state, and restore it.

The client code (GUI elements, command history, etc.) isn't coupled to
concrete command classes because it works with commands via the command
interface. This approach lets you introduce new commands into the app
without breaking any existing code.

##  Applicability

::::::::: applicability
::: applicability-problem
Use the Command pattern when you want to parameterize objects with
operations.
:::

::: applicability-solution
The Command pattern can turn a specific method call into a stand-alone
object. This change opens up a lot of interesting uses: you can pass
commands as method arguments, store them inside other objects, switch
linked commands at runtime, etc.

Here's an example: you're developing a GUI component such as a context
menu, and you want your users to be able to configure menu items that
trigger operations when an end user clicks an item.
:::

::: applicability-problem
Use the Command pattern when you want to queue operations, schedule
their execution, or execute them remotely.
:::

::: applicability-solution
As with any other object, a command can be serialized, which means
converting it to a string that can be easily written to a file or a
database. Later, the string can be restored as the initial command
object. Thus, you can delay and schedule command execution. But there's
even more! In the same way, you can queue, log or send commands over the
network.
:::

::: applicability-problem
Use the Command pattern when you want to implement reversible
operations.
:::

::: applicability-solution
Although there are many ways to implement undo/redo, the Command pattern
is perhaps the most popular of all.

To be able to revert operations, you need to implement the history of
performed operations. The command history is a stack that contains all
executed command objects along with related backups of the application's
state.

This method has two drawbacks. First, it isn't that easy to save an
application's state because some of it can be private. This problem can
be mitigated with the [Memento](memento.html) pattern.

Second, the state backups may consume quite a lot of RAM. Therefore,
sometimes you can resort to an alternative implementation: instead of
restoring the past state, the command performs the inverse operation.
The reverse operation also has a price: it may turn out to be hard or
even impossible to implement.
:::
:::::::::
::::::::::

::: {.section .checklist}
##  How to Implement {#checklist}

1.  Declare the command interface with a single execution method.

2.  Start extracting requests into concrete command classes that
    implement the command interface. Each class must have a set of
    fields for storing the request arguments along with a reference to
    the actual receiver object. All these values must be initialized via
    the command's constructor.

3.  Identify classes that will act as *senders*. Add the fields for
    storing commands into these classes. Senders should communicate with
    their commands only via the command interface. Senders usually don't
    create command objects on their own, but rather get them from the
    client code.

4.  Change the senders so they execute the command instead of sending a
    request to the receiver directly.

5.  The client should initialize objects in the following order:

    -   Create receivers.
    -   Create commands, and associate them with receivers if needed.
    -   Create senders, and associate them with specific commands.

-    *Single Responsibility Principle*. You can decouple classes that
    invoke operations from classes that perform these operations.
-    *Open/Closed Principle*. You can introduce new commands into the
    app without breaking existing client code.
-    You can implement undo/redo.
-    You can implement deferred execution of operations.
-    You can assemble a set of simple commands into a complex one.

-    The code may become more complicated since you're introducing a
    whole new layer between senders and receivers.

##  Relations with Other Patterns {#relations}

-   [Chain of Responsibility](chain-of-responsibility.html),
    [Command](command.html), [Mediator](mediator.html) and
    [Observer](observer.html) address various ways of connecting senders
    and receivers of requests:

    -   *Chain of Responsibility* passes a request sequentially along a
        dynamic chain of potential receivers until one of them handles
        it.
    -   *Command* establishes unidirectional connections between senders
        and receivers.
    -   *Mediator* eliminates direct connections between senders and
        receivers, forcing them to communicate indirectly via a mediator
        object.
    -   *Observer* lets receivers dynamically subscribe to and
        unsubscribe from receiving requests.

-   Handlers in [Chain of Responsibility](chain-of-responsibility.html)
    can be implemented as [Commands](command.html). In this case, you
    can execute a lot of different operations over the same context
    object, represented by a request.

    However, there's another approach, where the request itself is a
    *Command* object. In this case, you can execute the same operation
    in a series of different contexts linked into a chain.

-   You can use [Command](command.html) and [Memento](memento.html)
    together when implementing "undo". In this case, commands are
    responsible for performing various operations over a target object,
    while mementos save the state of that object just before a command
    gets executed.

-   [Command](command.html) and [Strategy](strategy.html) may look
    similar because you can use both to parameterize an object with some
    action. However, they have very different intents.

    -   You can use *Command* to convert any operation into an object.
        The operation's parameters become fields of that object. The
        conversion lets you defer execution of the operation, queue it,
        store the history of commands, send commands to remote
        services, etc.

    -   On the other hand, *Strategy* usually describes different ways
        of doing the same thing, letting you swap these algorithms
        within a single context class.

-   [Prototype](prototype.html) can help when you need to save copies of
    [Commands](command.html) into history.

-   You can treat [Visitor](visitor.html) as a powerful version of the
    [Command](command.html) pattern. Its objects can execute operations
    over various objects of different classes.
