## Core Settings

| Setting | Type | Options | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `mode` | enum | `interactive`, `yolo` | `interactive` | `yolo` auto-approves decisions; `interactive` confirms at each step |
| `granularity` | enum | `coarse`, `standard`, `fine` | `standard` | Controls phase count: `coarse` (3-5), `standard` (5-8), `fine` (8-12) |
| `model_profile` | enum | `quality`, `balanced`, `budget`, `inherit` | `balanced` | Model tier for each agent (see [Model Profiles](#model-profiles)) |
| `project_code` | string | any short string | (none) | Prefix for phase directory names (e.g., `"ABC"` produces `ABC-01-setup/`). Added in v1.31 |
| `response_language` | string | language code | (none) | Language for agent responses (e.g., `"pt"`, `"ko"`, `"ja"`). Propagates to all spawned agents for cross-phase language consistency. Added in v1.32 |
| `context_profile` | string | `dev`, `research`, `review` | (none) | Execution context preset that applies a pre-configured bundle of mode, model, and workflow settings for the current type of work. Added in v1.34 |
| `claude_md_path` | string | any file path | `./CLAUDE.md` | Custom output path for the generated CLAUDE.md file. Useful for monorepos or projects that need CLAUDE.md in a non-root location. Defaults to `./CLAUDE.md` at the project root. Added in v1.36 |
| `claude_md_assembly.mode` | enum | `embed`, `link` | `embed` | Controls how managed sections are written into CLAUDE.md. `embed` (default) inlines content between GSD markers. `link` writes `@.planning/<source-path>` instead — Claude Code expands the reference at runtime, reducing CLAUDE.md size by ~65% on typical projects. `link` only applies to sections that have a real source file; `workflow` and fallback sections always embed. Per-block overrides: `claude_md_assembly.blocks.<section>` (e.g. `claude_md_assembly.blocks.architecture: link`). Added in v1.38 |
| `context` | string | any text | (none) | Custom context string injected into every agent prompt for the project. Use to provide persistent project-specific guidance (e.g., coding conventions, team practices) that every agent should be aware of |
| `phase_naming` | string | any string | (none) | Custom prefix for phase directory names. When set, overrides the auto-generated phase slug (e.g., `"feature"` produces `feature-01-setup/` instead of the roadmap-derived slug) |
| `brave_search` | boolean | `true`/`false` | auto-detected | Override auto-detection of Brave Search API availability. When unset, GSD checks for `BRAVE_API_KEY` env var or `~/.gsd/brave_api_key` file |
| `firecrawl` | boolean | `true`/`false` | auto-detected | Override auto-detection of Firecrawl API availability. When unset, GSD checks for `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` env var or `~/.gsd/firecrawl_api_key` file |
| `exa_search` | boolean | `true`/`false` | auto-detected | Override auto-detection of Exa Search API availability. When unset, GSD checks for `EXA_API_KEY` env var or `~/.gsd/exa_api_key` file |
| `search_gitignored` | boolean | `true`/`false` | `false` | Legacy top-level alias for `planning.search_gitignored`. Prefer the namespaced form; this alias is accepted for backward compatibility |

> **Note:** `granularity` was renamed from `depth` in v1.22.3. Existing configs are auto-migrated.

---

## Workflow Toggles

All workflow toggles follow the **absent = enabled** pattern. If a key is missing from config, it defaults to `true`.

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `workflow.research` | boolean | `true` | Domain investigation before planning each phase |
| `workflow.plan_check` | boolean | `true` | Plan verification loop (up to 3 iterations) |
| `workflow.verifier` | boolean | `true` | Post-execution verification against phase goals |
| `workflow.auto_advance` | boolean | `false` | Auto-chain discuss → plan → execute without stopping |
| `workflow.nyquist_validation` | boolean | `true` | Test coverage mapping during plan-phase research |
| `workflow.ui_phase` | boolean | `true` | Generate UI design contracts for frontend phases |
| `workflow.ui_safety_gate` | boolean | `true` | Prompt to run /gsd-ui-phase for frontend phases during plan-phase |
| `workflow.ui_review` | boolean | `true` | Run visual quality audit (`/gsd-ui-review`) after phase execution in autonomous mode. When `false`, the UI audit step is skipped. |
| `workflow.node_repair` | boolean | `true` | Autonomous task repair on verification failure |
| `workflow.node_repair_budget` | number | `2` | Max repair attempts per failed task |
| `workflow.research_before_questions` | boolean | `false` | Run research before discussion questions instead of after |
| `workflow.discuss_mode` | string | `'discuss'` | Controls how `/gsd-discuss-phase` gathers context. `'discuss'` (default) asks questions one-by-one. `'assumptions'` reads the codebase first, generates structured assumptions with confidence levels, and only asks you to correct what's wrong. Added in v1.28 |
| `workflow.max_discuss_passes` | number | `3` | Maximum number of question rounds in discuss-phase before the workflow stops asking. Useful in headless/auto mode to prevent infinite discussion loops. |
| `workflow.skip_discuss` | boolean | `false` | When `true`, `/gsd-autonomous` bypasses the discuss-phase entirely, writing minimal CONTEXT.md from the ROADMAP phase goal. Useful for projects where developer preferences are fully captured in PROJECT.md/REQUIREMENTS.md. Added in v1.28 |
| `workflow.text_mode` | boolean | `false` | Replaces AskUserQuestion TUI menus with plain-text numbered lists. Required for Claude Code remote sessions (`/rc` mode) where TUI menus don't render. Can also be set per-session with `--text` flag on discuss-phase. Added in v1.28 |
| `workflow.use_worktrees` | boolean | `true` | When `false`, disables git worktree isolation for parallel execution. Users who prefer sequential execution or whose environment does not support worktrees can disable this. Added in v1.31 |
| `workflow.code_review` | boolean | `true` | Enable `/gsd-code-review` and `/gsd-code-review-fix` commands. When `false`, the commands exit with a configuration gate message. Added in v1.34 |
| `workflow.code_review_depth` | string | `standard` | Default review depth for `/gsd-code-review`: `quick` (pattern-matching only), `standard` (per-file analysis), or `deep` (cross-file with import graphs). Can be overridden per-run with `--depth=`. Added in v1.34 |
| `workflow.plan_bounce` | boolean | `false` | Run external validation script against generated plans. When enabled, the plan-phase orchestrator pipes each PLAN.md through the script specified by `plan_bounce_script` and blocks on non-zero exit. Added in v1.36 |
| `workflow.plan_bounce_script` | string | (none) | Path to the external script invoked for plan bounce validation. Receives the PLAN.md path as its first argument. Required when `plan_bounce` is `true`. Added in v1.36 |
| `workflow.plan_bounce_passes` | number | `2` | Number of sequential bounce passes to run. Each pass feeds the previous pass's output back into the validator. Higher values increase rigor at the cost of latency. Added in v1.36 |
| `workflow.plan_chunked` | boolean | `false` | Enable chunked planning mode. When `true` (or when `--chunked` flag is passed to `/gsd-plan-phase`), the orchestrator splits the single long-lived planner Task into a short outline Task followed by N short per-plan Tasks (~3-5 min each). Each plan is committed individually for crash resilience. If a Task hangs and the terminal is force-killed, rerunning with `--chunked` resumes from the last completed plan. Particularly useful on Windows where long-lived Tasks may hang on stdio. Added in v1.38 |
| `workflow.code_review_command` | string | (none) | Shell command for external code review integration in `/gsd-ship`. Receives changed file paths via stdin. Non-zero exit blocks the ship workflow. Added in v1.36 |
| `workflow.tdd_mode` | boolean | `false` | Enable TDD pipeline as a first-class execution mode. When `true`, the planner aggressively applies `type: tdd` to eligible tasks (business logic, APIs, validations, algorithms) and the executor enforces RED/GREEN/REFACTOR gate sequence. An end-of-phase collaborative review checkpoint verifies gate compliance. Added in v1.36 |
| `workflow.cross_ai_execution` | boolean | `false` | Delegate phase execution to an external AI CLI instead of spawning local executor agents. Useful for leveraging a different model's strengths for specific phases. Added in v1.36 |
| `workflow.cross_ai_command` | string | (none) | Shell command template for cross-AI execution. Receives the phase prompt via stdin. Must produce SUMMARY.md-compatible output. Required when `cross_ai_execution` is `true`. Added in v1.36 |
| `workflow.cross_ai_timeout` | number | `300` | Timeout in seconds for cross-AI execution commands. Prevents runaway external processes. Added in v1.36 |
| `workflow.ai_integration_phase` | boolean | `true` | Enable the `/gsd-ai-integration-phase` command. When `false`, the command exits with a configuration gate message |
| `workflow.auto_prune_state` | boolean | `false` | When `true`, automatically prune stale entries from STATE.md at phase boundaries instead of prompting |
| `workflow.pattern_mapper` | boolean | `true` | Run the `gsd-pattern-mapper` agent between research and planning to map new files to existing codebase analogs |
| `workflow.subagent_timeout` | number | `600` | Timeout in seconds for individual subagent invocations. Increase for long-running research or execution phases |
| `workflow.inline_plan_threshold` | number | `3` | Maximum number of tasks in a phase before the planner generates a separate PLAN.md file instead of inlining tasks in the prompt |

### Recommended Presets

| Scenario | mode | granularity | profile | research | plan_check | verifier |
|----------|------|-------------|---------|----------|------------|----------|
| Prototyping | `yolo` | `coarse` | `budget` | `false` | `false` | `false` |
| Normal development | `interactive` | `standard` | `balanced` | `true` | `true` | `true` |
| Production release | `interactive` | `fine` | `quality` | `true` | `true` | `true` |

---

## Planning Settings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `planning.commit_docs` | boolean | `true` | Whether `.planning/` files are committed to git |
| `planning.search_gitignored` | boolean | `false` | Add `--no-ignore` to broad searches to include `.planning/` |
| `planning.sub_repos` | array of strings | `[]` | Paths of nested sub-repos relative to the project root. When set, GSD-aware tooling scopes phase-lookup, path-resolution, and commit operations per sub-repo instead of treating the outer repo as a monorepo |

### Auto-Detection

If `.planning/` is in `.gitignore`, `commit_docs` is automatically `false` regardless of config.json. This prevents git errors.

---

## Hook Settings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `hooks.context_warnings` | boolean | `true` | Show context window usage warnings via context monitor hook |
| `hooks.workflow_guard` | boolean | `false` | Warn when file edits happen outside GSD workflow context (advises using `/gsd-quick` or `/gsd-fast`) |
| `statusline.show_last_command` | boolean | `false` | Append `last: /<cmd>` suffix to the statusline showing the most recently invoked slash command. Opt-in; reads the active session transcript to extract the latest `<command-name>` tag (closes #2538) |

The prompt injection guard hook (`gsd-prompt-guard.js`) is always active and cannot be disabled — it's a security feature, not a workflow toggle.

### Private Planning Setup

To keep planning artifacts out of git:

1. Set `planning.commit_docs: false` and `planning.search_gitignored: true`
2. Add `.planning/` to `.gitignore`
3. If previously tracked: `git rm -r --cached .planning/ && git commit -m "chore: stop tracking planning docs"`

---

## Agent Skills Injection

Inject custom skill files into GSD subagent prompts. Skills are read by agents at spawn time, giving them project-specific instructions beyond what CLAUDE.md provides.

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `agent_skills` | object | `{}` | Map of agent types to skill directory paths |

### Configuration

Add an `agent_skills` section to `.planning/config.json` mapping agent types to arrays of skill directory paths (relative to project root):

```json
{
  "agent_skills": {
    "gsd-executor": ["skills/testing-standards", "skills/api-conventions"],
    "gsd-planner": ["skills/architecture-rules"],
    "gsd-verifier": ["skills/acceptance-criteria"]
  }
}
```

Each path must be a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file. Paths are validated for safety (no traversal outside project root).

### Supported Agent Types

Any GSD agent type can receive skills. Common types:

- `gsd-executor` -- executes implementation plans
- `gsd-planner` -- creates phase plans
- `gsd-checker` -- verifies plan quality
- `gsd-verifier` -- post-execution verification
- `gsd-researcher` -- phase research
- `gsd-project-researcher` -- new-project research
- `gsd-debugger` -- diagnostic agents
- `gsd-codebase-mapper` -- codebase analysis
- `gsd-advisor` -- discuss-phase advisors
- `gsd-ui-researcher` -- UI design contract creation
- `gsd-ui-checker` -- UI spec verification
- `gsd-roadmapper` -- roadmap creation
- `gsd-synthesizer` -- research synthesis

### How It Works

At spawn time, workflows call `gsd-sdk query agent-skills <type>` (or legacy `node gsd-tools.cjs agent-skills <type>`) to load configured skills. If skills exist for the agent type, they are injected as an `<agent_skills>` block in the Task() prompt:

```xml
<agent_skills>
Read these user-configured skills:
- @skills/testing-standards/SKILL.md
- @skills/api-conventions/SKILL.md
</agent_skills>
```

If no skills are configured, the block is omitted (zero overhead).

### CLI

Set skills via the CLI:

```bash
gsd-sdk query config-set agent_skills.gsd-executor '["skills/my-skill"]'
```

---

## Feature Flags

Toggle optional capabilities via the `features.*` config namespace. Feature flags default to `false` (disabled) — enabling a flag opts into new behavior without affecting existing workflows.

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `features.thinking_partner` | boolean | `false` | Enable thinking partner analysis at workflow decision points |
| `features.global_learnings` | boolean | `false` | Enable cross-project learnings pipeline (auto-copy at phase completion, planner injection) |
| `learnings.max_inject` | number | `10` | Maximum number of cross-project learnings injected into each planner prompt. Lower values reduce prompt size; higher values provide broader historical context |
| `intel.enabled` | boolean | `false` | Enable queryable codebase intelligence system. When `true`, `/gsd-intel` commands build and query a JSON index in `.planning/intel/`. Added in v1.34 |

<a id="graphify-settings"></a>
### Graphify Settings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `graphify.enabled` | boolean | `false` | Enable the project knowledge graph. When `true`, `/gsd-graphify` builds and queries a graph in `.planning/graphs/`. Added in v1.36 |
| `graphify.build_timeout` | number (seconds) | `300` | Maximum seconds allowed for a `/gsd-graphify build` run before it aborts. Added in v1.36 |

### Usage

```bash
# Enable a feature
gsd-sdk query config-set features.global_learnings true

# Disable a feature
gsd-sdk query config-set features.thinking_partner false
```

The `features.*` namespace is a dynamic key pattern — new feature flags can be added without modifying `VALID_CONFIG_KEYS`. Any key matching `features.<name>` is accepted by the config system.

---

## Parallelization Settings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `parallelization` | boolean | `true` | Shorthand for `parallelization.enabled`. Setting `parallelization false` disables parallel execution without changing other sub-keys |
| `parallelization.enabled` | boolean | `true` | Run independent plans simultaneously |
| `parallelization.plan_level` | boolean | `true` | Parallelize at plan level |
| `parallelization.task_level` | boolean | `false` | Parallelize tasks within a plan |
| `parallelization.skip_checkpoints` | boolean | `true` | Skip checkpoints during parallel execution |
| `parallelization.max_concurrent_agents` | number | `3` | Maximum simultaneous agents |
| `parallelization.min_plans_for_parallel` | number | `2` | Minimum plans to trigger parallel execution |

> **Pre-commit hooks and parallel execution**: When parallelization is enabled, executor agents commit with `--no-verify` to avoid build lock contention (e.g., cargo lock fights in Rust projects). The orchestrator validates hooks once after each wave completes. STATE.md writes are protected by file-level locking to prevent concurrent write corruption. If you need hooks to run per-commit, set `parallelization.enabled: false`.

---

## Git Branching

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `git.branching_strategy` | enum | `none` | `none`, `phase`, or `milestone` |
| `git.base_branch` | string | `main` | The integration branch that phase/milestone branches are created from and merged back into. Override when your repo uses `master` or a release branch |
| `git.phase_branch_template` | string | `gsd/phase-{phase}-{slug}` | Branch name template for phase strategy |
| `git.milestone_branch_template` | string | `gsd/{milestone}-{slug}` | Branch name template for milestone strategy |
| `git.quick_branch_template` | string or null | `null` | Optional branch name template for `/gsd-quick` tasks |

### Strategy Comparison

| Strategy | Creates Branch | Scope | Merge Point | Best For |
|----------|---------------|-------|-------------|----------|
| `none` | Never | N/A | N/A | Solo development, simple projects |
| `phase` | At `execute-phase` start | One phase | User merges after phase | Code review per phase, granular rollback |
| `milestone` | At first `execute-phase` | All phases in milestone | At `complete-milestone` | Release branches, PR per version |

### Template Variables

| Variable | Available In | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `{phase}` | `phase_branch_template` | `03` (zero-padded) |
| `{slug}` | Both templates | `user-authentication` (lowercase, hyphenated) |
| `{milestone}` | `milestone_branch_template` | `v1.0` |
| `{num}` / `{quick}` | `quick_branch_template` | `260317-abc` (quick task ID) |

Example quick-task branching:

```json
"git": {
  "quick_branch_template": "gsd/quick-{num}-{slug}"
}
```

### Merge Options at Milestone Completion

| Option | Git Command | Result |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Squash merge (recommended) | `git merge --squash` | Single clean commit per branch |
| Merge with history | `git merge --no-ff` | Preserves all individual commits |
| Delete without merging | `git branch -D` | Discard branch work |
| Keep branches | (none) | Manual handling later |

---

## Gate Settings

Control confirmation prompts during workflows.

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `gates.confirm_project` | boolean | `true` | Confirm project details before finalizing |
| `gates.confirm_phases` | boolean | `true` | Confirm phase breakdown |
| `gates.confirm_roadmap` | boolean | `true` | Confirm roadmap before proceeding |
| `gates.confirm_breakdown` | boolean | `true` | Confirm task breakdown |
| `gates.confirm_plan` | boolean | `true` | Confirm each plan before execution |
| `gates.execute_next_plan` | boolean | `true` | Confirm before executing next plan |
| `gates.issues_review` | boolean | `true` | Review issues before creating fix plans |
| `gates.confirm_transition` | boolean | `true` | Confirm phase transition |

---

## Safety Settings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `safety.always_confirm_destructive` | boolean | `true` | Confirm destructive operations (deletes, overwrites) |
| `safety.always_confirm_external_services` | boolean | `true` | Confirm external service interactions |

---

## Security Settings

Settings for the security enforcement feature (v1.31). All follow the **absent = enabled** pattern. These keys live under `workflow.*` in `.planning/config.json` — matching the shipped template and the runtime reads in `workflows/plan-phase.md`, `workflows/execute-phase.md`, `workflows/secure-phase.md`, and `workflows/verify-work.md`.

These keys live under `workflow.*` — that is where the workflows and installer write and read them. Setting them at the top level of `config.json` is silently ignored.

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `workflow.security_enforcement` | boolean | `true` | Enable threat-model-anchored security verification via `/gsd-secure-phase`. When `false`, security checks are skipped entirely |
| `workflow.security_asvs_level` | number (1-3) | `1` | OWASP ASVS verification level. Level 1 = opportunistic, Level 2 = standard, Level 3 = comprehensive |
| `workflow.security_block_on` | string | `"high"` | Minimum severity that blocks phase advancement. Options: `"high"`, `"medium"`, `"low"` |

---

## Review Settings

Configure per-CLI model selection for `/gsd-review`. When set, overrides the CLI's default model for that reviewer.

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `review.models.gemini` | string | (CLI default) | Model used when `--gemini` reviewer is invoked |
| `review.models.claude` | string | (CLI default) | Model used when `--claude` reviewer is invoked |
| `review.models.codex` | string | (CLI default) | Model used when `--codex` reviewer is invoked |
| `review.models.opencode` | string | (CLI default) | Model used when `--opencode` reviewer is invoked |
| `review.models.qwen` | string | (CLI default) | Model used when `--qwen` reviewer is invoked |
| `review.models.cursor` | string | (CLI default) | Model used when `--cursor` reviewer is invoked |

### Example

```json
{
  "review": {
    "models": {
      "gemini": "gemini-2.5-pro",
      "qwen": "qwen-max"
    }
  }
}
```

Falls back to each CLI's configured default when a key is absent. Added in v1.35.0 (#1849).

---

## Manager Passthrough Flags

Configure per-step flags that `/gsd-manager` appends to each dispatched command. This allows customizing how the manager runs discuss, plan, and execute steps without manual flag entry.

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
|---------|------|---------|-------------|
| `manager.flags.discuss` | string | (none) | Flags appended to discuss-phase commands (e.g., `"--auto"`) |
| `manager.flags.plan` | string | (none) | Flags appended to plan-phase commands (e.g., `"--skip-research"`) |
| `manager.flags.execute` | string | (none) | Flags appended to execute-phase commands (e.g., `"--validate"`) |

**Example:**

```json
{
  "manager": {
    "flags": {
      "discuss": "--auto",
      "plan": "--skip-research",
      "execute": "--validate"
    }
  }
}
```

Invalid flag tokens are sanitized and logged as warnings. Only recognized GSD flags are passed through.

Agents without an explicit profile row (`gsd-advisor-researcher`, `gsd-assumptions-analyzer`, `gsd-security-auditor`, `gsd-user-profiler`, and the nine advanced agents — `gsd-ai-researcher`, `gsd-domain-researcher`, `gsd-eval-planner`, `gsd-eval-auditor`, `gsd-framework-selector`, `gsd-code-reviewer`, `gsd-code-fixer`, `gsd-debug-session-manager`, `gsd-intel-updater`) inherit the runtime default model for the selected profile. To pin a specific model for any of these agents, use `model_overrides` (next section) — `model_overrides` accepts any shipped agent name regardless of whether it has a profile row here. The authoritative profile table lives in `get-shit-done/bin/lib/model-profiles.cjs`; the authoritative 31-agent roster lives in [`docs/INVENTORY.md`](INVENTORY.md).

### Per-Agent Overrides

Override specific agents without changing the entire profile:

```json
{
  "model_profile": "balanced",
  "model_overrides": {
    "gsd-executor": "opus",
    "gsd-planner": "haiku"
  }
}
```

Valid override values: `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`, `inherit`, or any fully-qualified model ID (e.g., `"openai/o3"`, `"google/gemini-2.5-pro"`).

### Non-Claude Runtimes (Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Kilo)

When GSD is installed for a non-Claude runtime, the installer automatically sets `resolve_model_ids: "omit"` in `~/.gsd/defaults.json`. This causes GSD to return an empty model parameter for all agents, so each agent uses whatever model the runtime is configured with. No additional setup is needed for the default case.

If you want different agents to use different models, use `model_overrides` with fully-qualified model IDs that your runtime recognizes:

```json
{
  "resolve_model_ids": "omit",
  "model_overrides": {
    "gsd-planner": "o3",
    "gsd-executor": "o4-mini",
    "gsd-debugger": "o3",
    "gsd-codebase-mapper": "o4-mini"
  }
}
```

The intent is the same as the Claude profile tiers -- use a stronger model for planning and debugging (where reasoning quality matters most), and a cheaper model for execution and mapping (where the plan already contains the reasoning).

**When to use which approach:**

| Scenario | Setting | Effect |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Non-Claude runtime, single model | `resolve_model_ids: "omit"` (installer default) | All agents use the runtime's default model |
| Non-Claude runtime, tiered models | `resolve_model_ids: "omit"` + `model_overrides` | Named agents use specific models, others use runtime default |
| Claude Code with OpenRouter/local provider | `model_profile: "inherit"` | All agents follow the session model |
| Claude Code with OpenRouter, tiered | `model_profile: "inherit"` + `model_overrides` | Named agents use specific models, others inherit |

**`resolve_model_ids` values:**

| Value | Behavior | Use When |
|-------|----------|----------|
| `false` (default) | Returns Claude aliases (`opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`) | Claude Code with native Anthropic API |
| `true` | Maps aliases to full Claude model IDs (`claude-opus-4-6`) | Claude Code with API that requires full IDs |
| `"omit"` | Returns empty string (runtime picks its default) | Non-Claude runtimes (Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Kilo) |

### Profile Philosophy

| Profile | Philosophy | When to Use |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| `quality` | Opus for all decision-making, Sonnet for verification | Quota available, critical architecture work |
| `balanced` | Opus for planning only, Sonnet for everything else | Normal development (default) |
| `budget` | Sonnet for code-writing, Haiku for research/verification | High-volume work, less critical phases |
| `inherit` | All agents use current session model | Dynamic model switching, **non-Anthropic providers** (OpenRouter, local models) |

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` | Override default config directory (`~/.claude/`) |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Detected by context monitor to switch hook event name |
| `WSL_DISTRO_NAME` | Detected by installer for WSL path handling |
| `GSD_SKIP_SCHEMA_CHECK` | Skip schema drift detection during execute-phase (v1.31) |
| `GSD_PROJECT` | Override project root for multi-project workspace support (v1.32) |

---

## Global Defaults

Save settings as global defaults for future projects:

**Location:** `~/.gsd/defaults.json`

When `/gsd-new-project` creates a new `config.json`, it reads global defaults and merges them as the starting configuration. Per-project settings always override globals.
